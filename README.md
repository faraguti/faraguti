<h1>Hello, I'm Felipe Faraguti!</h1>

## About Me

I'm a passionate Computer Information Technology student with a strong interest in Cloud Computing and Database Administration. My journey into technology started with a fascination for technology itself, and I've expanded my expertise into the realm of cloud solutions and infrastructure management.

I enjoy exploring new technologies and tools to enhance my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. My goal is to leverage technology to solve real-world problems and create innovative solutions. I also share my knowledge on YouTube through technology-related content.

Feel free to explore my projects and repositories, where I work on exciting tech-related projects and showcase my skills and learning journey.
